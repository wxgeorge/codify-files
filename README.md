codify-files
============

codify-files takes files and generate .cpp sources with arrays containing the binary content.

The intended use is to make configuration files accessible to a library running within some larger system without having to worry about deployment questions like "Where should these files live?" and "How shall I communicate this fact to my library at runtime?"
